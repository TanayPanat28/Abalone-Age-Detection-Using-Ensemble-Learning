# Abalone-Age-Detection-Using-Ensemble-Learning
This project presents an algorithmic assessment of ensemble learning and tree-based approaches for classifying abalone into four age categories. While the age of abalone can be determined in laboratory, this can be a time-consuming process, we provide a fast approach for assessing its age using decision trees and ensemble learning methods. The results
indicated that abalone age can be determined by its physical measurements with less time consumption. A pre-processing approach was performed to the dataset before constructing and training the model. We conducted various experiments using Decision Trees with pre-pruning, Random Forest Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and Simple Neural Network with ADAM optimizer. All the proposed models were trained on Abalone dataset procured from University of California at Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Of all the models applied, Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm yielded the highest accuracy of 86.0%, surpassing the rest of the models.
